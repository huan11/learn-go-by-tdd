## Usage 

1. initialize array : [N]type{value1, value2, ..., valueN}
2. iterate array:  use range 



## Knowledge

1. the size is array is encoded in its type

   If you try to pass an `[4]int` into a function that expects `[5]int`, it won't compile. They are different types so it's just the same as trying to pass a `string` into a function that wants an `int`.
